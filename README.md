# Project Overview
PyBer CEO has given you and your manager a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Analysis

1) There are more rides in Urban cities than the Suburban and Rural cities. Second most amount of rides are in Suburban cities. This result correlates with the population density and life style in those types of cities. The company can change the types of cars from sedans to trucks and 4x4 SUVs to increase the number of rides in rural cities. They are already getting the most average fare per ride in the rural cities and car type change may increase this average amount more. Since people usually drive trucks and SUVs in those cities, it will be easy to find more drivers. This change will also increase the total fare for rural cities which is the least as seen in the graph above.
 
2) To increase the number of rides in Suburban cities PyBer can change the type of the service. Instead of giving inhabitants there a ride to places, they can start a new program such as PyBer-Eat to bring the services such as food to the customer doors. A survey can be done among the people of suburban cities to learn what kind of services such as food, shopping, medicine and etc... are more popular among the population.

3) There are more rides in urban cities, however the average fare per ride is the least among all cities. To increase average fare per ride PyBer can implement some incentive programs such as that after 10 miles the fare per a mile drops. That way people can choose PyBer even for even longer distance rides. Another idea is to keep the fares low during morning and late afternoon hourse where public transportation is loaded with the people going to and leaving from their work. That way PyBer rides will be an alternative for public transportation. Even carpooling options can be added PyBer rides list.
